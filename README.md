# Chess-C-Sharp
This project started off as a school project for a course in Data Structures and Algorithms (See Chess-Python).

I expanded on it and made it into my own. Whearas, the original project was a console application, I made this into an interactive application. Instead of using Python, I ported the code into C# for speed and created a GUI using the .NET WPF in order for humans to interactively play chess against an intelligent chess player. The user interacts by clicking buttons on a window instead of typing values into Terminal.  

The chess engine runs using minimax and alpha-beta pruning algorithms.
